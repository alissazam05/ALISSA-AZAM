<h4>
    WANZA'S FAMILY
</h4>

<h5>
    Hi guys, so here's my family picture. If you guys wondering, Wanza stands by my mother's name which is Wan Zainab. She is a single mother of five kids. I am the youngest one, I have three brothers and one sister. All of my brothers are happily married except my sister. My eldest brother have one children named Adam Wildan, meanwhile my second brother have five childrens which is Aliff, Afiff, Aqiff, Airil and the last one is Aryan. OMG! i have six nephews hahaha!! i need a girl niece please *sobsob*. My third brother just got married last year and has not been endowed with offspring. So, me and my sister is still single hehe.

    My mom is a businesswoman, she own a furniture factory in Taman Semarak, Nilai, Negeri Sembilan since 2012. She is a very hardworking, independent woman. To me she is the strongest woman i've ever known. She raised all of her five kids by herself.

<h5>
    So let me tell you a bit about my family and our daily routine in life. As the youngest daughter in the family my job is to babysit my niece on weekdays and wekends, i need to help them babysit because of their work. But i still have some off day though if im going out with my friends hahaha. Since we are a big family, mom would always be busy even on the weekends so we barely spend time together, mom would always choose a day to spend time with the family by going on a vacation or maybe having a dinner just like how people would gather around on christmas! She would always find a time for us eventough she is busy working. She loves to spoil me and i couldnt be more grateful in life.She is my everything, the sun and light to my life. No words can describe how much i cherished her and that would be all about me and my big family!
